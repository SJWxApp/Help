<strong>App Mission:</strong><br>
Provide fast, intuitive, and smooth pictorial weather data for fighter aircrew - current and future forecasts.

<strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Powered By https://WindyTV.com <br>
The app initializes centered on Cherry Point NKT with the Wind overlay selected.  Six blue markers are visible  - Seymour Johnson, Kinston, Cherry Point, Shaw, Oceana, and Langley.  METARs and TAFs are automatically downloadeded for each marker.  To view the Metar/Taf for a base, simply touch the base's marker.  To see weather parameters (wind, temperature, pressure, etc.) at a position on the map, simply touch the desired position on the map.


<strong>Updating Metar/Taf:</strong><br>
As mentioned, the METARs/TAFs will be automatically gathered at initialization.  If at any time your device is still gathering METARS and TAFS the "METAR/TAF" button will be greyed out and disabled ("METAR/TAF" button visible after touching the white arrow in the bottom left of the screen). If the button is black (not grey), touching it will automatically regather the METARs/TAFs for the base markers and also update the sunrise/sunset times.

<strong>Sunset/Sunrise:</strong><br>
Powered by Suncalc - https://github.com/mourner/suncalc <br>
Stay with me here....no matter where you are in the world, sunrise and sunset are calculated for Seymour Johnson, AFB. Period.  This app will never ask for you to disclose your location. The time displayed, however, is shown in local time WHERE YOUR PHONE IS RIGHT NOW.  So, if you're in Alabama using the app, you need to add 1 hour (Central time converted to Eastern) to get the sunrise/sunset time for GSB.  

<strong>Changing Overlay:</strong><br>
Touch the white arrow at the bottom left of the screen.  Touch the applicable weather overlay Button.  With weaker internet connections, it may take up to 5 seconds or more for the overlay to be completely downloaded and displayed.

<strong>Changing Altitude:</strong><br>
Altitude changes are only available for the Wind and Temperature Overlays (API limitations).  Slide the vertical slider on the upper right of the screen to set desired altitude of the overlay for Wind or Temperature.   

<strong>Changing Time:</strong><br>
Time can be changed two ways.  In both cases time is adjusted in intervals of 3 hours.  The "Play" button at the bottom left of the screen moves the time forward in 3 hour intervals at a rate of 1.5 Hz.  Note: Unfortunately time changes do not affect the "Sea Temp" overlay (API limitations).  It only shows data for the current time.  You can also manually slide the horizontal slider to set the desired day/time.
